 ERROR: can not find a system report template to use for worst RNC;"The script determines dynamically which is the newest rsran_RUXX version on the system (by sort command). If that content directory does not have a RSRAN00.xml template, you get this message.
It means one of the following: 
a) Either no rsran directory (e.g. rsran_RU40) has not been identified by the dynamic finding code for example because of some change in the naming conventions. THen you have to seriously debug the script under the section if [ ""${RUN3GNQA}"" = ""YES"" ]; then ...
b) Or there is no rsran_RUXX directory at all, maybe because there is no 3G RAN on this OSS. THen you can disable collecting NQA worst RNC data collection by setting RUN3GNQA=NO in .bashrc
c) Or there is a rsran_RUXX directory identififed but does really not include the RSRAN000.xml file. You have to fix that manually by copying the file into place"

"ERROR: can not execute ""$RSRUN""";$RSRUN defines the rscmd executable (see in script header part) and the user of nsncc.sh can not execute it
"ERROR: can not descend into content dir ""$CONTENT""";$CONTENT defines the directory where adaptations for RSCMD are installed. Therefore XML templates can not be copied into place

"ERROR: KPI ""${KPI}"" from ""${XML}"" not found in content";Only comes up when used with --checkjobs option: In one of the XML report templates that are used a KPI is listed that is not found inside the Adaptations directory. The job will not work.
"ERROR: can not cd into ""[VALUE OF $CCCTRL]""";The main directory for nsncc.sh script, configuration and logfiles can not be accessed because it does not exists or permissions are wrong or because the CCCTRL variable (set in script header) points to the wrong directory

"ERROR: could not install missing adaptation ""[ERROR DETAILS]""";The script saw that an existing adaptation directory is different from the one in the archive and while trying to copy it from the unpacked archive to the $RSCMD/conten3 directory an error occurred
"ERROR: could not install metadata ""[ERROR DETAILS]""";The script saw that an existing metadata directory is different from the one in the archive and while trying to copy it from the unpacked archive to the $RSCMD/conten3 directory an error occurred
"ERROR: missing adaptation ""[EROR DETAILS]"" from both own and OSS archive !!";A properties file references an XML file in a adaptation directory that does not exist in the archive and not in the $RSCMD/content3 directory
"ERROR: can not find target for ""[ERROR DETAILS]"" in content3 subdirectory structure";An XML file that is referenced in a properties file can not be copied to its final directory (like e.g. ~/rsran_RU40/reports) because partent directories are missing AND can not simply be created by the script for some reason
"WARNING: required template '[DETAILS]"" not in nsncc archive - using existing local version";An XML template is referenced in a properties file but not contained in the unpacked archive. However, a local version of that template already exists which will be used and probably it will work. In normal cases, even if a local version exists it would be overwritten by the version that is contained in the archive. For convenience, this WARNING is sometimes accepted/created in purpose for example if default reports like RSRAN000 are used (it would not make much sense to carry them in the nsncc.sh archive because they are not customized and surely exist already ...)
"ERROR: can not copy ""[ERROR DETAILS]""";While trying to copy an XML template from the archive into the $RSCMD/content3 directory structure some generic error occurred
"WARNING: Had to create result dir ""[DETAILS]""";An output directory that has been defined in the beginning of the script and must be used in the properties files does not exist but has been created. Mind, that the output directories under $RSCMD/exports are not taken from the properties files but statically defined. This makes sense because they must be agreed with Cloud Controller anyway and can not just be any value found in a properties file.
ERROR: can not find a system report template to use for worst RNC;"3G NQA is active and should be enabled but the script can not find the RSRAN000.xml template for some reason. Most likel;y there is no 3G and 3GNQA should be set to NO in .bashrc or there is some error related to the rsran_RUXX directory name (i.e. script expects different name than actually found on the system)"
"ERROR: can not source configuration in file ""${SQC_CONF}""";At the end the script shall run (sic! Not read!) its own configuration file and executes its functions but for some reason here the file can not be run. This error is very unlikely when the script runs normal so far because it will generate the file each time it runs anew and change its permissions to +x. Most likelt when you see this option something is really weird like e.g. file system mounted without execute permissions or similar
