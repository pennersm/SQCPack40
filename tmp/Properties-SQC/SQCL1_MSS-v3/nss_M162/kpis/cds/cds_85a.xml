	  <br> Indicates call blocking % of circuit groups.
	  <br>Also calls completed successfully via another CGR are counted blocked on the CGR where attempt was blocked.

	  <br>This KPI is similar with tra_msc85b but, this one, is to be used only for the CDS NE.

<use_experience><![CDATA[ 
<br>If call is succeeded via an alternative route then no erlang is lost from network level point of view.
<br>However, some erlang is lost in that CGR, but the call is not lost. In case of BSC CGRs when MSC reserves the circuit congestion info is available
<br>for both MO and MT calls, but congestion is presented always in the outgoing direction, so from measurement it is seen as congestion would happen 
<br>only for MT call.In case of a BSC CGR calls are counted in IN and OUT direction as wel depending whether the call is orig or term, but congestion 
<br>is counted only in OUT direction and an orig call can also be congested as MSC reserves the CRCT normally, so in this case also the IN call attempt 
<br>should be added to the denominator, BUT in a IN direction CGR the IN call amount should NOT be added.  KPI does not work with SIP CGRs.
