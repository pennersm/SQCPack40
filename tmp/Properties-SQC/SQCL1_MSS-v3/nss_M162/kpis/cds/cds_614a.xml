<use_experience><![CDATA[ 
<br>In case of BSC CGRs when MSC reserves the circuit congestion info is available for both MO and MT calls, but congestion is presented always in the 
<br>outgoing direction, so from measurement it is seen as congestion would happen only for MT call. KPI does not work with SIP CGRs.
<br>NOTE1: If the highest congestion % over time is seen more valuable by the end user, then take RAW data and use "MAX" as aggregation rule.
<br>NOTE2: The counter CGRCGROUP_TIMECONG_PERCENTX100 only provides SIP CGR related values in case virtual circuits support with SIP CGRs is active (sales item number L.1478/C.1478).
