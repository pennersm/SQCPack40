      <use>Number of call attempts (0...9999999).This counter shows the number of call attempts (0...9999999). The counter
is updated in originating call case when MSC Server receives the
CM_Service_request message. In a terminating case
the counter is updated when MSC Sends the SETUP message, in incoming
call case it is updated when the termination to the incoming side
is reserved, i.e. at the reception of the ADD_Reply command.
IN an outgoing case it is updated when the termination to the outgoing
side is reserved, i.e. when MSS receives the ADD Reply message from
the MGW. Note that one call may be counted twice if the VMSC address
in the incoming/originating side of the call is different
from the outgoing/terminating side.</use>
