      <use>Either the Paging Response is received over Iu/A interface (this is the CSFB case, possible in case of call, USSD, LCS services) or SGsAP-SERVICE-REQUEST received (this is possible in case of SMS) for the paging attempts (SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST) sent on the SGs interface. It is also updated, in such case, when CSFB happens to different MSS, so VLR receies a Cancel Location message from the HLR for the paged subscriber. This event means that the paging procedure have been successfully performed.</use>
