<br>The MSC Server controls several MGWs. When the first one rejects the resource reservation for some reason and the next MGW is tried, this counter is updated.
<br>
<br>Updating conditions:
<br>&#149; When the MGW rejects the resource reservation request, the MSS tries to reserve resources from another MGW. If the connection is disconnected by this rejection, the field is not updated.
<br>&#149; The field is updated immediately after the rejection.
