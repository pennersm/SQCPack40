    <br>This report provides the external clear codes distribution per signalling protocol (CCs received from the network).
	<br>The external protocol to be analysed is the one object filtered.
	<br>This report provides the occurrences of individual external, signalling-specific clear codes per signalling method on all circuit groups.
	<br>The clear codes are external, that is, they are received from the network. If two clear codes are for some reason received for a call, the one that is received first is recorded.
