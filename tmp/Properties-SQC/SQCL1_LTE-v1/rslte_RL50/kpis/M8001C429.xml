      <use><![CDATA[This counter provides the average number of RRC connected UEs which have set the "deviceType" in the "UE-EUTRA-Capability" to "noBenFromBatConsumpOpt", that is which have indicated to the network (eNB) that they do not foresee to benefit from network-based battery consumption optimization (3GPP TS 36.331, TS 36.306), that is which have indicated that their power supply resources are not limited to the small battery of a normal UE (for example LTE smart phone with limited battery life) but that they have access to unlimited power supply resources (for example LTE USB-stick connected to a PC using the PC power supply resources). UPDATED: eNB-internal average calculation of the number of RRC connected UEs which have set the "deviceType" in the "UE-EUTRA-Capability" to "noBenFromBatConsumpOpt" (3GPP TS 36.331, TS 36.306); the average is calculated as the arithmetical average over the measurement period.]]></use>
