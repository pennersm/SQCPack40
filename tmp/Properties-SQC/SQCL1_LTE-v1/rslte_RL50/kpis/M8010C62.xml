      <use><![CDATA[This counter provides the number of dedicated PDCCH resource allocations (eNB -> UE) for PDSCH transmissions with HARQ reporting in case that the eNB was not able to detect the HARQ response (ACK/NACK) from the UE; i.e. this counter provides the number of dedicated PDCCH resource allocations by which the eNB informs a dedicated UE on the PDCCH about the allocated PDSCH resources which are used for PDSCH transmissions with HARQ reporting in case that the eNB was not able to detect the HARQ response (ACK/NACK) from the UE. This counter is only updated when the eNB was not able to detect the HARQ response (ACK/NACK) from the UE. Therefore, either a transmission error for the downlink PDCCH resource allocation (eNB -> UE) or a transmission error for the uplink HARQ response (UE -> eNB) has occured. UPDATED: The counter is updated when DTX is received for PDSCH transmission.]]></use>
