      <use><![CDATA[The Ratio of  BBE to total seconds in available time at the Far End (ITU-T G.826). An errored block is a block in which one or more bits were in error. B3 byte in section overhead header (SOH) is used for the path termination section error monitoring using Bit Interleaved Parity 8 (BIP-8) code, in an even parity. The BIP-8 is computed over all bits or previous STM frames after scrambling and is placed in byte B3 of the current frame before scrambling. In this case the block means STM-1 frame. The STM-1 payload cell rate is 149760 kbit/s. The path termination section is one of the SDH layers (regeneration, multiplex and path) (ITU-T G.707).]]></use>
