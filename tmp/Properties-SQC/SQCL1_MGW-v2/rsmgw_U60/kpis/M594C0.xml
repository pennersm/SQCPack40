      <use>The total number of WAC (Windows Access Control) Gate requests that has been released and rejected. 
	When an entity wants to establish some kind of a signalling connection, such as an AAL2 signalling connection, 
	it should firstly ask permission from WAC Gate. If the maximum number of accesses is reached, the request is rejected 
	or put into a queue, waiting for resources to be released by other. With WAC in place, it is possible to 
	protect system resources and prevent overload situations. 
  UPDATED:When a resource request is released or rejected in WAC Gate, this counter will be updated.</use>
