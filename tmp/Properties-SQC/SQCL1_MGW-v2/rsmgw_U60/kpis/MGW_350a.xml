      <use><![CDATA[Total ingress CLP1 cells discarded because of thresholding. This counter tells how many low priority cells buffer management has discarded on ingress. When the buffer fill level exceeds the CLP1 threshold, only CLP0 cells are accepted to the buffer and CLP1 cells are discarded. When the buffer fill level exceeds the CLP0+1 threshold, no cells are accepted to the buffer (all cells are discarded). The CLP1 cells that are discarded because of CLP1 and CLP0+1 thresholds are counted by this counter. CLP1 and CLP0+1 thresholding parameters are fixed by the system.]]></use>
