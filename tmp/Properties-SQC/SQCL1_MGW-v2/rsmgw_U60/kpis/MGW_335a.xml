      <use><![CDATA[The Ratio of  SES to total seconds in available time at the Near End (ITU-T G.826). The number of one second periods which contain >= threshold errored blocks or at least one defect. The threshold can be handled by Exchange terminal configuration handling MML. At the end of each one second interval the contents of the counters may be obtained by the relevant managed objects. The object is the path termination section (B3) errors. In this case the block means STM-1 frame. The STM-1 payload cell rate is 149760 kbit/s. The path termination section is one of the SDH layers (regeneration, multiplex and path) (ITU-T G.707).]]></use>
