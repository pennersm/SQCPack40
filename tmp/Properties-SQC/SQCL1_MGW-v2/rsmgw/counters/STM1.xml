The BIP-8 is computed over all bits or previous STM frames after scrambling, and is placed in byte B1 of the current frame before scrambling. In this case the block means STM-1 frame.

      <use>Path termination section background block errors at the Far End (ITU-T G.826). An errored block is a block in which one or more bits were in error. B3 byte in section overhead header (SOH) is used for the path termination section error monitoring using Bit Interleaved Parity 8 (BIP-8) code in an even parity. The BIP-8 is computed over all bits or previous STM frames after scrambling and is placed in byte B3 of the current frame before scrambling. In this case the block means STM-1 frame. The STM-1 payload cell rate is 149760 kbitps. The path termination section is one of the SDH layers (regeneration and multiplex and path) (ITU-T G.707).
Note: This counter doesn't have a formula and the default (SUM) was used.
