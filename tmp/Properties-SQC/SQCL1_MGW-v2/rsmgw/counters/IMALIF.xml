This means that the ICP is in the expected frame position with unexpected IMA OAM Label, unexpected LID, unexpected IMA ID, unexpected IMA frame number, unexpected ICP cell offset, or the received M not equal to the expected M of the IMA group.

The number of one second intervals at Near End containing &gt;=30% of the ICP cells counted as IV-IMA or one or more link defects (e.g. LOS, OOF/LOF, AIS or LCD), LIF or LODS defects. This does not include defects during UAS-IMA condition. UPDATED: SES_IMA counter is updated (meaning that a second is defined as a severely errored second) when 30 % or more of the ICP cells received from the link are err ored. The errored ICP cells are counted as errored according to the IV-IMA (IV is ICP cell violation) definition. Also the more severe errors in the link, such as LOS, OOF/L OF, AIS, LCD, LIF or LODS, automatically cause the second to be considered as severely errored.

It mean s ICP at the expected frame position with unexpected IMA OAM Label or unexpected LID or unexpected IMA ID or received M not equal to expected M of the IMA group or unexpecte d IMA frame number or unexpected ICP cell offset.

This does not include defects during UAS-IMA condition. UPDATED:SES_IMA counter is updated (meaning that a second is defined as a severely errored second) when 30% or more of the ICP cells received from the link are errored. The errored ICP cells are counted as errored accordi ng to the IV-IMA (IV is ICP cell violation) definition. Also the more severe errors in the link, such as LOS, OOF/LOF,AIS,LCD,LIF or LODS, automatically cause the second to be considered as severely errored.
