      <title><![CDATA[Call attempts terminated in call congestion]]></title>
      <use>Number of call attempts (0...65535) terminated in call congestion. A call attempt terminates in call congestion
if all the available circuits have already been reserved, or if
the Automatic Congestion Control (ACC) or Selective Circuit Reservation (SCR)
features are used to limit the traffic. Call Congestion counter
is updated for all circuit groups where circuit reservation attempt
leads to congestion. This is done even if alternative routes have
been defined (this means that the call setup continues on an alternative
route).Call congestion is updated of all known congested
calls. That includes mobile originating calls (BSC circuit groups)
and originating calls from PBX types for which the MSC takes care
of the hunting of free circuits. The total congestion in circuit
group measurement is measured and reported as outgoing congestion (OUT)
because the direction of congestion is not available. The
field is empty if the value is not available. Note:
The column name is misleading for historical reasons. Despite the column
name there is no multiplication by 100 contained in this counter.</use>
