<br>This KPI counts those cases, when the resource is reserved for the call. This is happening, for example, when on the A interface the ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE is received, so we managed to reserve successfully the TCH on the air interface and we reserved the circuit also in the A interface. In CGR measurement this is shown in the CALLS counters.
