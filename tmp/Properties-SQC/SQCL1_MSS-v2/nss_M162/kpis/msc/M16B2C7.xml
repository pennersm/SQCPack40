      <use>Time congestion percentage (0.0...100.0) in the circuit group in relation to the results accumulation period. Principle
of time congestion (TC) calculation: Time congestion
in a circuit group is calculated in relation to the results accumulation
period. Time congestion is calculated when all time
slots available on the circuit group are in use, or the state of circuits
prevents their use for outgoing traffic. Calculating time congestion
is stopped when there are again time slots available (one or more
calls are released, circuits are added, or the state of the circuit changes
so that it becomes available for outgoing traffic).The
field is only used for outgoing (OUT) circuit groups (including
the OUT circuits in bidirectional circuit groups) (0.0...100.0%).The
field is empty if the value is not available.</use>
