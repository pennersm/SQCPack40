      <title><![CDATA[Traffic in the traffic category]]></title>
      <use>The amount of traffic in the traffic category in Erlangs (0.0...999999.9). That means the total reservation time of
the measured object in relation to the results accumulation period. The
 Erlangs are calculated from circuit seizure to circuit release.
In combination categories the Erlang calculation starts when both
circuits are seized. In combination categories the end point of
erlang calculation is determined by the circuit that is released
first. All of the circuit reservation time is updated
in the results accumulation period in which the circuit is released (and
in combination categories in the results accumulation period in
which the first released circuit is released). For this reason remarkably
large values in the Erlangs field are possible in a case in which
there are many calls that have started before the results accumulation
period but that end in the results accumulation period.</use>
