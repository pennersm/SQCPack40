<use_experience><![CDATA[ 
<br>If an MT SMS is temp fail, than the system will try to send it again and can send it several times and several times it can temp fail, i.e. if the subscriber is out of coverage-> this way the formula may give a low success rate, however finally the temp fail SMS can suceeded and no SMS is lost! The temp fail counters had been removed from the denominator.
