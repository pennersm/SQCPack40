<br>THEORETICAL SUMMARY LEVELS: MSC

<br>RECOMMENDED SUMMARY LEVELS: MSC
<br>
<br>KPI CLASS: Service
<br>MEASUREMENT(S): Traffic category measurement (M20/14H)
<br>
<br>NOTES: This NSN KPI is partially compliant with ex-S &quot;MTC Success Rate&quot; KPI.
<br>This KPI is not fully comparable with ex-S KPI since it uses different approach and counters with different trigger points. KPI includes both 2G + 3G analysis. In this NSN mapping KPI, contrary to the ex-S approach, the errors due to other exchange were are not included in the success factors.
<br>Anyway this KPI tries to reach as much as possible an ex-S equivalent approach and also provides the MTC success rate.
