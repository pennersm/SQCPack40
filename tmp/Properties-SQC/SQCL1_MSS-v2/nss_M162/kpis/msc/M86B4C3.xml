      <use>This line appears in the ASCII report if a fault happened during the data collecting. It means that the
printed authentication counters are not reliable. (The problem can
be: some of the VLRUs don't work, overloaded situation).
In XML report the allowed value for this counter is '1' and
is sent only in case when 'DATA MISSING IN TRANSFERRED
VECTOR COUNTERS' line appears in ASCII report.</use>
