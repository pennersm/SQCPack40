<br>
<br>NOTES: This NSN KPI is partially compliant with ex-S &quot;IN/CAMEL Dialog Failure Ratio&quot; KPI.
<br>This KPI only provides the CAMEL Dialog Failure Ratio.
<br>The IN/CAMEL failure conditions that are being considered in this KPI are different from ex-S approach. Despite of so, we can still talk about a mapping KPI.
