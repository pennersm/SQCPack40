      <title><![CDATA[Traffic in the circuit group (IN)]]></title>
      <use>The amount of traffic on the circuit group in Erlangs (0.0...9999.9). That means the total reservation time
of the object being measured in relation to the results accumulation
period. The Erlangs are calculated from circuit seizure
to circuit release. All of the circuit reservation time
is updated in the results accumulation period in which the circuit
is released. For this reason, remarkably large values in the ERLANGS
field are possible in a case in which there are many calls that
have started before the results accumulation period but that end
in the results accumulation period. In such a case, the value in the
ERLANGS field can be greater than the value of the fields CRTS and AVECR.</use>
