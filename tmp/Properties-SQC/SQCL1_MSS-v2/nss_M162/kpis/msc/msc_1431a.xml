<br>Tcat_IDs:
<br>1 => ORIG
<br>2 => TERM
<br>
<br>Note1: With selected Tcat_IDs (ORIG+TERM) all 3G call attempts terminated in CC GROUP8 are counted.
<br>
<br>Note2: To measure call attempts terminated in CC GROUP8 for each individual traffic category, please consider the following Tcat_IDs:
<br>           
<br>           ->   &quot;3G Originating call attempts per RNC terminating in CC Group8&quot; => Tcat_ID: 1 (ORIG)
<br>           ->   &quot;3G Originating VOICE call attempts per RNC terminating in CC Group8&quot; => Tcat_ID: 9 (VOICE ORIG)
<br>           ->   &quot;3G Originating DATA call attempts per RNC terminating in CC Group8&quot; => Tcat_ID: 13 (DATA ORIG)
<br>           ->   &quot;Originating VIDEO call attempts per RNC terminating in CC Group8&quot; => Tcat_ID: 5 (VIDEO ORIG)
<br>
<br>           ->   &quot;3G Terminating call attempts per RNC terminating in CC Group8&quot; => Tcat_ID: 2 (TERM)
<br>           ->   &quot;3G Terminating VOICE call attempts per RNC terminating in CC Group8&quot; => Tcat_ID: 10 (VOICE TERM)
<br>           ->   &quot;3G Terminating DATA call attempts per RNC terminating in CC Group8&quot; => Tcat_ID: 14 (DATA TERM)
<br>           ->   &quot;Terminating VIDEO call attempts per RNC terminating in CC Group8&quot; => Tcat_ID: 6 (VIDEO TERM)
<br>
<br>           ->   &quot;3G Incoming terminating call attempts per RNC terminating in CC Group8&quot; Tcat_ID: 4 (INC-TERM)
<br>           ->   &quot;3G Incoming terminating VOICE call attempts per RNC terminating in CC Group8&quot; Tcat_ID: 12 (VOICE INC-TERM)
<br>           ->   &quot;3G Incoming terminating DATA call attempts per RNC terminating in CC Group8&quot; Tcat_ID: 16 (DATA INC-TERM)
<br>           ->   &quot;Incoming terminating VIDEO call attempts per RNC terminating in CC Group8&quot; Tcat_ID: 8 (VIDEO INC-TERM)
<br>
<br>           ->   &quot;3G Originating outgoing call attempts per RNC terminating in CC Group8&quot; Tcat_ID: 3 (ORIG-OUT)
<br>           ->   &quot;3G Originating outgoing VOICE call attempts per RNC terminating in CC Group8&quot; Tcat_ID: 11 (VOICE ORIG-OUT)
<br>           ->   &quot;3G Originating outgoing DATA call attempts per RNC terminating in CC Group8&quot; Tcat_ID: 15 (DATA ORIG-OUT)
<br>           ->   &quot;Originating outgoing VIDEO call attempts per RNC terminating in CC Group8&quot; Tcat_ID: 7 (VIDEO ORIG-OUT)
<br>
<br>Note3: Clear Codes selection for CC GROUP8 is customer dependent. Here are some examples:
<br>
<br>         - To measure the number of calls terminating due to no answer:
<br>           GROUP6 Clear Codes:
<br>           0006 - B ANSWER TIME OUT
<br>           0007 - CALL WAITING TIME OUT
<br>
<br>         - To measure the number of calls terminating due to call reject:
<br>           GROUP8 Clear codes:
<br>           0206 &#150; CALL REJECTED
<br>           0220 &#150; ANONYMOUS CALLS REJECTION
<br>
<br>         - To measure the number of calls terminating due to early release (before alerting):
<br>           GROUP8 Clear codes:
<br>           030A &#150; CLEAR/A ONHOOK DURING SET-UP PHASE
<br> 
<br>         - To measure the number of calls terminating due to release during alerting:
<br>           GROUP8 Clear codes:
<br>           030B &#150; CLEAR/A ONHOOK DURING WAIT FOR ANSWER PHASE
