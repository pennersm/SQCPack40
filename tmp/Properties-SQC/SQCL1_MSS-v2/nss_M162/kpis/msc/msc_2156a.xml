		<use_experience><![CDATA[ 
		<br>Same KPI as msc_571c. New KPI ID reference starting from M15.1.
		<br>
		<br>This BHCA does not include HO cases. Use only with busy hour criteria, not with weekly or monthly aggregation.
		<br>Starting from M14.6, the 3G traffic also includes I-HSPA traffic.
		<br>
		<br>Used Traffic categories:
		<br>15 = DEVICE ORIG = The call is originating from the MSC itself. Typically occurs in case of Selective Ringback Tone service, Parallel alerting, etc. 
		<br>16 = SCP ORIG = The call is initiated by the SCP. Typically occurs in case of CAMEL ph 3 operation (ICA)
		<br>32 = 2G ORIG = call is originating from 2G radio access (Means the number of CM_SERVICE_REQUEST messages)
		<br>34 = 3G ORIG = call is originating from 3G radio access (Means the number of CM_SERVICE_REQUEST messages)
		<br>45 = INCNOHO = call is coming from trunk (means the number of IAM messages)
		<br>74 = SIP ORIG = SIP originating traffic
		<br>
		<br>RECOMMENDED SUMMARY LEVELS: MSC
		<br>KPI CLASS: Traffic
		<br>MEASUREMENT(S): Traffic category measurement (M20/14H)
