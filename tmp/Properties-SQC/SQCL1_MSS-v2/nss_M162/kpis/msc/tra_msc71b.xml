<use_experience><![CDATA[ 
<br>Normally circuit selection and reservation is done in the originating network element, so congestions are normally seen on the outgoing reservations. The situation is different for circuit groups to BSCs. If normal A-interface circuit allocaiton is used, it is always the MSC, which selects and reserves the circuit. In this case circuit congetsions can be seen in the MSC both for mobile originated and for mobile terminated calls. If reversed A-interface circuit allocation is used (the BSC selects the circuit), then call congestion cannot be seen in the MSC for the circuit groups towards the BSC.
