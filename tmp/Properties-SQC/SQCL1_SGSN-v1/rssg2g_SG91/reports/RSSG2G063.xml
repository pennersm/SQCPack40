    <help_text><![CDATA[<br>Report gives information about capacity performance indicators (subscribers, PDP contexts, RABs in use and data throughput) and the amount of Gb and Iu access attaches, PDP context activation and downlink dropped bytes that were rejected due to license usage exceeded.
<br>Note, to see the full content of this report the optional feature codes 327, 346 and 888 must be purchased and activated in the SGSN.
<br>Use case specific instructions:
<br>- This report can be used to plan, report and order HW and SW expansions resulting from network growth.
<br>- Run 'Common / PAPU user' report if PAPU subscriber and PAPU PDP context capacity needs to be analyzed.
<br>- Run 'Common / Attach resources' report if SMMU subscriber capacity needs to be analyzed.
<br>- Run 'Common / Traffic' report if PAPU level information for "Ratio of dropped bytes due to capacity limit exceeded" KPI is required.
<br>- Note, the peak values are applicable on SGSN level only.
<br>
<br>There are also following alarms related with license usage:
<br>
<br>3295 - LICENCE_CAPACITY_EXCEEDED_A 
<br>License capacity exceeded: This (three star) alarm is set if licensed capacity is exceeded, separately for 2G, 3G, SGSN subscriber, and PDP context capacity. The feature code and capacity limit is printed out. The alarm is cancelled when capacity addition is installed or all increments are removed. (Operator is also able to cancel alarm by the MML). Feature code (hex) in the additional field indicates what is the feature the alarm is related.
<br>
<br>3294 - LICENCE_CAPACITY_WARNING_A 
<br>License capacity warning: This (two star) alarm is set if a warning limit (90% of licensed capacity) is exceeded separately for 2G, 3G, SGSN subscriber, and PDP context capacity. The feature code, capacity limit, and reached capacity warning value is printed out.
<br>
<br>145 - HW_LIMITS_CAPACITY_FIGURES_A
<br>Hardware limits capacity figures: The hardware in the SGSN limits the capacity to a lower level than otherwise provided. This notice is set if the SGSN total attach capacity license is provided above 320k subscribers with CPU CP710-A or above 640k with MBIF-A in MCHU.]]></help_text>
