      <use >Average percentage of the paging buffer capacity. This counter indicates the average paging buffer occupancy percentage during the reporting period. The range of this counter is 0 -100% with 1% intervals. Each time a paging multiframe cycle ends the occupancy percentage (occupied buffer space versus maximum space) of each paging queue is calculated, which is (100*N)/N(max)%.
The sum and number of all average buffer occupancy values during the reporting period are stored. When it is time to send a CCCH_LOAD_INDICATION message, an average is calculated and reported in the message as the average buffer occupancy percentage during the reporting period.</use>
