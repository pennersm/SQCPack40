      <use><![CDATA[The number of total uplink power (RTWP) measurement report samples in which the power value is inside Class 2 range (-107 dBm <=RTWP< -106 dBm). Note: All the received power is taken into account, not just Rel99. UPDATED: This counter is updated periodically according to the RNC internal timer whose period with WBTS is RRIndPeriod and with NBxxx the period is min(PrxTotalReportPeriod, PtxTotalPeriod). When the timer expires, the RTWP value is calculated based on the information of the latest received power value in an NBAP: COMMON MEASUREMENT REPORT or NBAP-PRIVATE: RADIO RESOURCE MEASUREMENT REPORT sent by the BTS, and the reported RTWP value is inside Class 2 range.]]></use>
