      <use><![CDATA[Multiplex section background block errors at the far end. An errored block is a block in which one or more bits have an error. M1 byte conveys the count of errored blocks which is calculated by the far end from its receiving blocks by using B2 bytes at multiplexer level. B2 bytes are the bytes allocated for a multiplex section error monitoring function which is Bit Interleaved Parity 24 (BIP-24) code using even parity. The BIP-24 is computed over all bits of the previous STM frame exluding RSOH and is placed in byte B2 of the current frame. In this case the block means STM-1 frame. UPDATED:The counter is incremented when one or more bit errors are detected in a block (STM-1 frame excluding the RSOH). The counter is not updated during SES and UAS conditions.]]></use>
