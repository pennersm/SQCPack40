UPDATED:When the RNC receives either RANAP: RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST (release RAB) or RANAP: IU RELEASE COMMAND message from the CN, and the RNC has sent IU/RAB RELEASE REQUEST message to the CN before that, and the release is requested because the UE is not responding to an RRC message or the UE is responding with such failure message that the connection must be released, and the RAB type is CS data conversational. If the CN does not send a release message to the RNC within certain time period, the RAB is released anyway and this counter is updated. (See the section "Failure and abnormal release causes" for more details.)]]></use>
