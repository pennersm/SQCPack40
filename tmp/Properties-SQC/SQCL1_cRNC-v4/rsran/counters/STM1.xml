      <use>Path termination section errored seconds at the far end. The number of seconds with one or more errored blocks or at least one defect. At the end of each one second interval the contents of the counters are obtained by the relevant managed objects. The objects are the path termination section (G1) errors and HP-RDI. In this case the block means virtual container. UPDATED:The counter is incremented when a second contains one or more errored blocks or at least one defect. The counter is not updated during the UAS condition.</use>

      <use>Path termination section severely errored seconds at the far end. The number of one second periods which contain &gt;= threshold errored blocks or at least one defect. The threshold can be handled by Exchange terminal configuration handling YAN-MML. At the end of each one second interval the contents of the counters may be obtained by the relevant managed objects. The objects are the path termination section (G1) errors and HP-RDI. In this case the block means virtual container. The path termination section is one of the SDH layers (regeneration, multiplex and path) (ITU-T G.707). During the SES condition counter FE_PATH3_ES M513C40 is also incremented. UPDATED:The counter is incremented when a second contains errored blocks more or equal to that in the defined threshold or at least one defect. The counter is not updated during the UAS condition.</use>
