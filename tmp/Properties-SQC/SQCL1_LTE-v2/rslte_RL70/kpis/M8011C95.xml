      <use><![CDATA[This counter is a part of the histogram "Cell DL Available Capacity (DL AC)" and provides the number of events when the measured downlink AC of the cell was in the range 80 &lt; PDCCH AC &lt;= 100.Load balancing is activated to shift traffic from the high-loaded LTE serving cell to the lower-loaded LTE neighbor cell by favoring handovers from the serving cell to the neighbor cell (by applying neighbor-cell-related handover thresholds that favor handovers to the neighbor cell).The PDCCH AC of the cell is measured by the eNB internally and is used by the eNB in the context of cell load measurements for load balancing between cells (3GPP TS 36.423). A PDCCH AC value of "0" indicates no available capacity, and a value of "100" indicates maximum available capacity in the cell (see 3GPP TS 36.423).	UPDATED: Every second the Cell DL Available Capacity (AC) for PDCCH is measured by an eNB internal measurement. This counter is updated if the measured cell PDCCH AC was in the range 80 &lt; PDCCH AC &lt;= 100.]]></use>
