    <report-description>The LTE SINR measurement (M8031) contains PM counters related to SINR (Signal-to-interference plus Noise Ratio). This includes at present downlink SINR measurements(cf.LTE1491) or potentially future comparable measurements. The PM counters are updated per cell. For MCC/MNC primary PLMN-Id shall be used.</report-description>

      <use>This measurement is provided for Subband 13 downlink Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) post-compensation values that are greater than 26 dB and less than or equal to 28 dB. Subband 13 for 20 MHz refers to PRB#96 to PRB#99. UPDATED: This measurement is updated for each UE every TTI by using the UE's most recent subband CQI to calculate Subband 13 downlink SINR post-compensation and the bin is incremented every sample period (5 seconds) with the respective number of calculated values where each one is greater than 26 dB and less than or equal to 28 dB. Subband 13 for 20 MHz refers to PRB#96 to PRB#99.

      <use>This measurement is provided for Subband 13 downlink Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) post-compensation values (2 CQIs or codewords) that are greater than -6 dB and less than or equal to -4 dB. Subband 13 for 20 MHz refers to PRB#96 to PRB#99. UPDATED: This measurement is updated for each UE every TTI by using the UE's most recent subband CQIs (i.e. 2 CQIs or codewords) to calculate Subband 13 downlink SINR post-compensation and the bin is incremented every sample period (5 seconds) with the respective number of calculated values where each one is greater than -6 dB and less than or equal to -4 dB.

      <use>This measurement is provided for Subband 13 downlink Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) post-compensation values (2 CQIs or codewords) that are greater than 24 dB and less than or equal to 26 dB. Subband 13 for 20 MHz refers to PRB#96 to PRB#99. UPDATED: This measurement is updated for each UE every TTI by using the UE's most recent subband CQIs (i.e. 2 CQIs or codewords) to calculate Subband 13 downlink SINR post-compensation and the bin is incremented every sample period (5 seconds) with the respective number of calculated values where each one is greater than 24 dB and less than or equal to 26 dB. Subband 13 for 20 MHz refers to PRB#96 to PRB#99.

UPDATED: This measurement is updated for each UE every TTI by using the UE's most recent wideband CQIs (i.e. 2 CQIs or codewords) to calculate Wideband downlink SINR post-compensation and the bin is incremented every sample period (5 seconds) with the respective number of calculated values where each one is greater than 16 dB and less than or equal to 18 dB.
