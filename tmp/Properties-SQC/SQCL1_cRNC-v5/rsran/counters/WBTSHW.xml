      <use>The counter shows how many utilization rate samples have been detected within the (&gt;20 - 40)% class per uplink direction. Each utilization rate sample calculates the number of Channel Elements (CE) in use in HSPA divided by the number of all available (licensed) CEs. Note: This counter is not supported anymore in Rel2 BTS HW with WN7.0 or later SW. The valid R99 CE and HSPA user amount counters in Rel2 BTS HW are provided by M5006 measurement (counters M5006C0...C38). UPDATED: The counter is incremented when the sample of the utilization rate is within (&gt;20 - 40)% class.
