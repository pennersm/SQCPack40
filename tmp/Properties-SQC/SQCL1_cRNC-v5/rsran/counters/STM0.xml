      <use>Multiplex section errored second at the Far End. The number of seconds with one or more errored blocks or at least one defect. At the end of each one second interval the contents of the counters are obtained by the relevant managed objects. The object is multiplex section (B2) errors. In this case the block means STM-0 frame. The STM-0 payload cell rate is 149760 kbit/s. The multiplex section is one of the SDH layers (regeneration, multiplex and path) (ITU-T G.707).
Note: This counter doesn't have a formula and the default (SUM) was used.

These ten seconds are considered to be part of unavailable time. A new period of available time begins at the start of ten consecutive non-SES events. These ten seconds are considered to be part of available time.

      <use>Path termination section background block errors at the Far End (ITU-T G.826). An errored block is a block in which one or more bits were in error. B3 byte in section overhead header (SOH) is used for the path termination section error monitoring using Bit Interleaved Parity 8 (BIP-8) code in an even parity. The BIP-8 is computed over all bits or previous STM frame after scrambling and is placed in byte B3 of the current frame before scrambling. In this case the block means STM-0 frame. The STM-0 payload cell rate is 51840 kbit/s. The path termination section is one of the SDH layers (regeneration, multiplex and path) (ITU-T G.707).
