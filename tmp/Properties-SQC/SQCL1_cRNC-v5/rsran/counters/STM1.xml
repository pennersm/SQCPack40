M1 byte conveys the count of errored blocks which is calculated by the far end from its receiving blocks by using B2 bytes at multiplexer level. B2 bytes are the bytes allocated for a multiplex section error monitoring function which is Bit Interleaved Parity 24 (BIP-24) code using even parity.

      <use>Path termination section errored seconds at the far end. The number of seconds with one or more errored blocks or at least one defect. At the end of each one second interval the contents of the counters are obtained by the relevant managed objects. The objects are the path termination section (G1) errors and HP-RDI. In this case the block means virtual container. UPDATED:The counter is incremented when a second contains one or more errored blocks or at least one defect. The counter is not updated during the UAS condition.
Note: This counter doesn't have a formula and the default (SUM) was used.

      <use>Path termination section severely errored seconds at the far end. The number of one second periods which contain &gt;= threshold errored blocks or at least one defect. The threshold can be handled by Exchange terminal configuration handling YAN-MML. At the end of each one second interval the contents of the counters may be obtained by the relevant managed objects. The objects are the path termination section (G1) errors and HP- RDI. In this case the block means virtual container. During the SES condition counter FE_PATH2_ES M513C36 is also incremented. UPDATED:The counter is incremented when a second contains errored blocks more or equal to that in the defined threshold or at least one defect. The counter is not updated during the UAS condition.
Note: This counter doesn't have a formula and the default (SUM) was used.

      <use>Path termination section unavailable seconds at the far end. A period of unavailable time begins at the start of ten consecutive severely errored second (SES) events. These ten seconds are considered to be part of the unavailable time. A new period of available time begins at the start of ten consecutive non-SES events. These ten seconds are considered to be part of the available time. UPDATED:The counter is updated after ten consecutive severely errored second (SES) events are detected. These ten seconds are included in the counter. Updating the counter is stopped when ten consecutive non-SES events are detected. These ten seconds are not included in the counter.
Note: This counter doesn't have a formula and the default (SUM) was used.

      <use>Path termination section background block errors at the far end. An errored block is a block in which one or more bits have an error. G1 byte in the section overhead header (SOH) is used for path termination section error monitoring using Bit Interleaved Parity 8 (BIP-8) code, in an even parity. The BIP-8 is computed over all the bits of the previous virtual container (VC-4) and is placed in byte B3 of the current frame. In this case the block means virtual container. UPDATED:The counter is incremented when one or more bit errors are detected in a block (virtual container). The counter is not updated during the SES and UAS conditions.
Note: This counter doesn't have a formula and the default (SUM) was used.

The threshold can be handled by Exchange terminal configuration handling YAN-MML. At the end of each one second interval the contents of the counters may be obtained by the relevant managed objects. The objects are the path termination section (G1) errors and HP-RDI. In this case the block means virtual container. The path termination section is one of the SDH layers (regeneration, multiplex and path) (ITU-T G.707). During the SES condition counter FE_PATH3_ES M513C40 is also incremented. UPDATED:The counter is incremented when a second contains errored blocks more or equal to that in the defined threshold or at least one defect. The counter is not updated during the UAS condition.
