      <use><![CDATA[The number of intra frequency soft handover attempts. This counter is updated for a measurement object in which source and target cells are defined. Also Inter-RNC handovers are counted. Branch addition: If cells A and B are in the active set and branch addition for cell C is attempted, this counter is updated by 1 for objects (A,C) and (B,C). Branch replacement: If cells A and B are in the active set and cell B is attempted to be replaced with cell C, this counter is updated by 1 for object (A,C) Branch deletion: This counter is not updated in branch deletion. UPDATED: When the SRNC starts resource allocation for a Branch Addition or Branch Replacement procedure.
