      <use><![CDATA[The number of RAB active failures caused by some reason not covered by the other failure counters for CS data conversational. UPDATED:When the RNC receives either an RANAP: RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST (release RAB) or RANAP: IU RELEASE COMMAND message from the CN, and the RNC has sent an IU/RAB RELEASE REQUEST message to the CN before that, and the release is requested due to some failure not covered by the other failure counters, and the RAB type is CS data conversational. If the CN does not send a release message to the RNC within certain time period, the RAB is released anyway and this counter is updated. The possible failure reasons updating this counter are for example RNC internal failure, transmission failure or loss of Frame Protocol synchronization.]]></use>
