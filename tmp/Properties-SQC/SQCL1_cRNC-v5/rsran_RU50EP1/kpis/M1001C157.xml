UPDATED:When the RNC receives either an RANAP: RAB ASSIGNMENT REQUEST (release RAB) or an RANAP: IU RELEASE COMMAND message from the CN, and the RNC has sent an IU/RAB RELEASE REQUEST message to the CN before that, and the release is requested due to BTS failure, and the RAB type is CS data conversational. If the CN does not send a release message to the RNC within certain time period, the RAB is released anyway and this counter is updated.
